Please find CP Point files in the folder. This includes both implementations (with and without the interface).

Also find Question 7 in ArrayTesting file.

Our test results have been added to the SEG2105A1_Tests pdf file.



Description: 
Converts and stores Polar/Cartesian Coordinates and Tests different forms of arrays and iterators to check efficiency 

First part of the assignment checks whether storing coordinates or converting on the spot is a better approach. Also implements an interface 

Second part of the assignment compares Arrays, ArrayLists, and Vectors to see which data structure is most efficient at adding elements and summing the components using iterators.
